    <p>These heavenly Swedish Meatballs are a homemade version of the iconic Ikea meatballs. They’re a whole lot easier than assembling flat-pack furniture, that’s for sure! Extra-soft and juicy, with a dash of classic spices like allspice, they’re smothered with the bread-mop-worthy sauce.</p>
    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>These heavenly Swedish Meatballs are a homemade version of the iconic Ikea meatballs. They’re a whole lot easier than assembling flat-pack furniture, that’s for sure! Extra-soft and juicy, with a dash of classic spices like allspice, they’re smothered with the bread-mop-worthy sauce.</li>
        <li>Bread – the secret to extra soft meatballs! Far more effective than breadcrumbs;</li>
        <li>Nutmeg and All Spice – the signature spicing, just a small, subtle amount. All Spice is a particular type of spice made from a plant called Pimenta dioica. It smells like cloves. It’s a common spice found in normal supermarkets, and costs no more than usual spices. Best substitute is Mixed Spice</li>
        <li>Beef stock/broth and cream – for the creamy gravy</li>
        <li>Flour – to thicken the gravy</li>
        <li>Egg – for binding the meatballs together</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h4>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use an ice cream scooper with a lever to scoop up the mixture. Standard size is 3 tablespoons – I use slightly less than the scoop (3 tablespoons is quite large);</li>
        <li>Scoop and dollop all the mixture;</li>
        <li>THEN roll them all;</li>
        <li>Voila! Even size meatballs, rolled relatively quickly!</li>
    </ol>
